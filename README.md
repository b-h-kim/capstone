# Capstone Project: Do Parks Gentrify Our Neighborhoods?

## Summary
This capstone project explores the relationship between parks and gentrification. It focuses on the following research questions:

Do parks contribute to gentrification?
If so, what kind of characteristics of parks
If so, are there shared characteristics of parks contributes gentrification?

## Data
The following data sources were used in this project:

U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates
Public Parks Boundaries GIS from Metropolitan Government of Nashville
Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI)

## Data Dictionary
Gentrification: A process in which a poor area experiences an influx of middle-class or wealthy people. For this project, gentrification is defined as a neighborhood with a median household income of $25,297 or below that experiences an increase in median household income of at least 10% over a 5-year period.

Park: An urban park that is open to the public and provides recreational opportunities, such as playgrounds, sports fields, and walking trails.

## Data Decisions
ACS 5 vs ACS 1: The 1-year estimates for an area reflect the most current data but they have larger margins of error than the 5-year estimates because they are based on a smaller sample. The 5-year estimates for an area have larger samples and smaller margins of error than the 1-year estimates. For this project, the 5-year ACS estimates were used because they provide more reliable data.

## Methods
The following methods were used in this project:

Data cleaning and preprocessing: The data was cleaned and preprocessed to remove errors and inconsistencies using python.
Exploratory data analysis: The data was explored using statistical methods to identify patterns and relationships.

## Results
The results of this project showed that there is some evidence of a correlation between parks and gentrification. Neighborhoods with parks were more likely to experience gentrification than neighborhoods without parks. However, the number of samples was small, so it is important to interpret these results with caution.

## Conclusion
The results of this project suggest that there may be a correlation between parks and gentrification. However, more research is needed to confirm this finding. Future research should include a larger sample of neighborhoods and should explore the mechanisms by which parks may contribute to gentrification.

## Next Steps
The next steps for this project include:

Expanding the study to include more cities.
Investigating the mechanisms by which parks contribute to gentrification.
Developing policies that can help to mitigate the negative effects of gentrification while maximizing the positive effects of parks.
